# CHAT-APPLICATION


**Client-Server Architecture:** Separates the chat application into client-side and server-side components.


**Java Client:** Handles user interface, connects to the server, and sends/receives messages.


**Java Server:** Manages client connections, routes messages between clients, and maintains chat history.


**Socket Programming:** Uses Java Sockets for network communication between client and server.


**Multithreading:** Allows the server to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.


**Message Handling:** Ensures messages are correctly formatted, sent, and displayed.


**User Authentication:** Verifies user identities before granting access to chat functionality.


**GUI Design:** Creates a user-friendly interface for the client application.


**Data Persistence:** Optionally stores chat history and user data.


**Error Handling:** Manages and logs communication errors and exceptions.
